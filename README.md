## 📥 Installation

### Option 1: Install as Root
If you are already root (or switch to root first), run:

```console
sudo su -
wget -O - https://github.com/OpenMediaVault-Plugin-Developers/packages/raw/master/install | bash
```

### Option 2: Install with Sudo
If you prefer not to switch to root, you can use `sudo`.
⚠️ Note: On the very first use of `sudo`, you will not see the password prompt.
Use `sudo` for both commands:

```console
sudo wget -O - https://github.com/OpenMediaVault-Plugin-Developers/packages/raw/master/install | sudo bash
```
